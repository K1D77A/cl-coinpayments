# cl-coinpayments
This is simply a helper library for using working with the original version of the 
coinpayment.net API, there is a new version of the API in the works.


# Intro
The coinpayment IPN (Instant Payment Notification) system sends messages to a listening 
server to inform the server of activity within their coinpayment account, whether this is 
to inform the user of a processed payment, whether a payment has failed etc. 
You can see the current docs on IPN's here: https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn
this library just helps with managing the IPN's you receive.

## Quick notes

The post data sent from the coinpayment server is formatted in snake case ie 
`i_am_a_variable` but when you convert the data into a plist representing an IPN, 
all the snake_case keys are converted to kebab case ie i-am-a-variable, so 
`ipn_type` would be the keyword `:IPN-TYPE`. Parsing is memoized so it should be
pretty fast.

# Working with IPN's

This section is talking about the IPN's, the next is about API calls.

## Parsing the IPN's

There is a generic function called `(parse-data data)` which accepts a list, a string or an 
array, with this it attempts to convert it to a PLIST.

 ```

## Verifying the source

coinpayment signs all its messages from the API with a HMAC header, with Hunchentoot you 
can extract that header like so: 

```lisp
 (let* ((headers (tbnl:headers-in*))
        (hmac (cdr (assoc :hmac headers))))
     hmac)
 ```
 
Now using the method `(verify-data hmac private-key raw-post)`
you can parse this header your IPN Secret, this is 
not your API secret key but the key *you* provided as a 'secret' 
"Your IPN Secret is a string of your choosing that is used to verify that an IPN was really sent from our servers "

and either the parsed plist, the raw-data or a string consisting of post parameters like so:

```lisp
  (let* ((headers (tbnl:headers-in*))
         (hmac (cdr (assoc :hmac headers)))
         (raw-data (tbnl:raw-post-data))
         (plist (cl-coinpayments::parse-data (tbnl:post-parameters*))))
    (when (and (string= (getf plist :merchant) *coinpayment-merchant-id*)
               (cl-coinpayments:verify-data hmac *coinpayment-ipn-secret*
                                             raw-data))
        <do something>
        ))
```

In the above example I also confirm that my merchants ID and the merchants ID sent are
the same.

## Working with the IPN

Now you have verified the legitimacy of your IPN you can construct a status object.

```lisp
CL-COINPAYMENTS> (construct-status *)
#<TWO {10196A08D3}>
(:AMOUNT "10.00000000" :AMOUNTI "1000000000" :CURRENCY "LTCT" :FEE "0.00000000"
 :FEEI "0" :FIAT-AMOUNT "1108.03029150" :FIAT-AMOUNTI "110803029150" :FIAT-COIN
 "GBP" :FROM "8ac9528d191f8fb3f5b9daa25538c4ae" :IPN-ID
 "f60f7391ec606d2631e6d53157906dbf" :IPN-MODE "hmac" :IPN-TYPE "transfer"
 :IPN-VERSION "1.0" :MERCHANT "oof" :STATUS "2" :STATUS-TEXT "Complete" :TXN-ID
 "CTFF3TMJI9OJAIJ8SSMJVKEBHJ")
 ```
 
This returns two values, with the most easily referenced being the new status object.
The status objects rules are described here: https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn 
Under the heading 'Payment Statuses'.
If the status cannot be determined (which probably means the request is bogus) 
the condition 'unknown-status is signalled.

 If you look in classes.lisp you can see the 
relationship between the status objects, CLOS is used to represent the relationship 
described in those docs, so the class one-hundred is a subclass of ipn-payment-success
and ipn-payment-success is a subclass of ipn-status etc, this is important for the next
part.
 
## Dispatching on statuses

This library has a means of creating functions that are executed based on the 
name of the dispatcher, the type of IPN sent from the server and the two main args the
class of the STATUS object and the number of arguments.
This is best demonstrated with an example:
```lisp

(def-ipn-dispatcher print-info ((foo :transfer) (ipn ipn-status) arg1)
  (print foo)
  (print ipn)
  (print "less specific")
  (print arg1))

(def-ipn-dispatcher print-info ((foo :transfer) (ipn ipn-status) arg1 arg2)
  (print foo)
  (print ipn)
  (print "less specific")
  (print arg1)
  (print arg2))

(def-ipn-dispatcher print-info ((foo :transfer) (ipn two) arg1)
  (print foo)
  (print ipn)
  (print "more specific"))

(def-ipn-dispatcher print-info ((foo :transfer) (ipn two) arg1 arg2)
  (print arg1)
  (print arg2))

  ```
Some example inputs using the function `(ipn-dispatch name ipn status args)`
```
CL-COINPAYMENTS> (ipn-dispatch 'print-info '(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") (make-instance 'zero) "abc")

(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") 
#<ZERO {1025E64EB3}> 
"less specific" 
"abc" 
"abc"


CL-COINPAYMENTS> (ipn-dispatch 'print-info '(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") (make-instance 'zero) "abc" "deeef")

(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") 
#<ZERO {1025E852C3}> 
"less specific" 
"abc" 
"deeef" 
"deeef"


CL-COINPAYMENTS> (ipn-dispatch 'print-info '(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") (make-instance 'two) "abc" "deeef")

"abc" 
"deeef" 
"deeef"

```
I assume you get the jist. Anyway you can use this to perform actions based the same types 
of IPN's but when they are in varying states.
There is the macro `(dispatch-ipn-by-name name ipn status args)` which does the same 
```lisp
CL-COINPAYMENTS> (dispatch-ipn-by-name print-info '(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") (make-instance 'ipn-status) "abc" "def")

(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") 
#<IPN-STATUS {1025E8F173}> 
"less specific" 
"abc" 
"def" 
"def"
```

If a dispatcher cannot be found for the args provided then the condition 
'no-dispatcher-found is signalled, you should wrap all calls to dispatch-ipn and 
dispatch-ipn-by-name within a handler-case to make sure you have some fallback 
functionality in the case the server sends something unexpected, which it has done for me...

Just a note the list '(:IPN-TYPE "transfer") is the most basic of IPN's represented as a
plist that is required for this to function, this is why it is used in the examples, in 
a real world example the IPN would be what has been received and parsed by (parse-data ..)

# Working with the API.

In cl-coinpayments API requests are all represented by objects, so if you wish to make 
an API call you instantiate an object of the request type, pass in the correct arguments
as initargs and then call the method `(request <instance>)` on it. Its important to note
that the :merchant-secret-key initarg is the special key *YOU* gave to coinpayments as your
secret, not the API secret automatically generated.

```lisp

CL-COINPAYMENTS> (make-instance 'get-basic-info :merchant-secret-key *coinpayment-private* :key *coinpayment-public*)
#<GET-BASIC-INFO {100230D643}>

```
This request has the following slots:
```lisp
[ ]  CMD                 = "get_basic_info"
[ ]  DEX-ALIST           = (("version" . "1") ("key" . <removed for privacy>) ("cmd" . "get_basic_info") ("format" . "json"))
[ ]  FORMAT              = "json"
[ ]  HMAC                = "c776c7821d4d7c785c5971652e6139ab5499ca3f7af195e8bd4dc5b56aeae91be8185e42a98d2af843bfa8a88062ac76362a5759f2cbdc612b9a6ece2a37a478"
[ ]  KEY                 = <removed for privacy>
[ ]  MERCHANT-SECRET-KEY = <removed for privacy>
[ ]  NONCE               = #<unbound>
[ ]  POST-STRING         = "version=1&key=<removed for privacy>&cmd=get_basic_info&format=json"
[ ]  REQUIRED            = (MERCHANT-SECRET-KEY KEY)
[ ]  VERSION             = "1"
```

All requests inherit their slots from the toplevel class `'request`, currently 
the nonce is not used but if you wanted to use it you can, if you set the value to an 
integer represented as a string then it will also be added into the post params and the HMAC.
The same goes for if you modify any of the slots that are used for storing values 
which are later used in the post request. You could change FORMAT to XML, however 
that would probably break `(request ..)` so maybe dont do that.

Each request within the docs https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-intro has its own class
and they are all listed in api-forms.lisp. 
If you try to make a request object without providing 'required' arguments then
you will get an error of type `'required-slots-not-bound' 
```lisp
CL-COINPAYMENTS> (make-instance 'create-transfer :merchant-secret-key *coinpayment-private* :key *coinpayment-public* :amount "1" :currency "btc")
; Debugger entered on #<REQUIRED-SLOTS-NOT-BOUND {1002506873}>
[1] CL-COINPAYMENTS> 
; Evaluation aborted on #<REQUIRED-SLOTS-NOT-BOUND {1002506873}>
```

I think that all of the API calls will work except maybe `create-mass-withdrawal` which 
I have not tested but it has some odd characteristics, so dont rely on it to work. 
If you do test it and find it doesn't work just open an issue and I'll fix it.
